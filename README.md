- 👩🏻‍🦳 Hi, I'm Hannah, but my username is @DrTemperance. Can you guess why?

- I am passionate about Math ⎷ and Science 🧬. I plan to pursue a degree 📜 in Pharmacology 💊 with a minor in Computer Science 💾, Physics 👩🏻‍🔬, and marine biology 🐬.
    * In the field of science 🧪, I am particularly fond of radioactivity ☢️ and halogens 💣, specifically Astatine and Iodine. Additionally, I am passionate about theoretical physics 🧠, particularly involving time and higher dimensions, such as timelines ⏰ and quantum entanglement ⚛️. -Oh yeah, and psychology, I guess.

- I am currently studying advanced mathematics 📈 and intermediate coding 💻. If you need to reach me, please get in touch with me directly; I don't have a life out of this.
    * Contact me through links on my website or my Email if I made it public. 📡
