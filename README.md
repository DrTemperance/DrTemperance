- 👩🏻‍🦳 Hi, I'm Hannah, but my username is @DrTemperance. Can you guess why?

- I have a passion for math and science. 🧬 I plan to pursue various studies or possible occupations, such as pharmacology, computer science, theoretical physics, and marine biology. In the realm of science, I am especially intrigued by radioactive particles. On top of that, I am fascinated with theoretical physics, especially regarding the concept of time alongside greater dimensions such as timelines, as well as the theory of quantum entanglement. ⚛️

- I am currently studying advanced mathematics 📈 and intermediate coding 💻. If you need to reach me, please get in touch with me directly; I don't have a life out of this.
